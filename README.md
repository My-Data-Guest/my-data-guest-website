My Data Guest Webpage

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Ensure the repository name is `my-data-guest` and the default branch is `main`.
2. The site is configured with Vite `base: '/my-data-guest/'` and a `gh-pages` script.
3. Deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This publishes the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch. Enable GitHub Pages to serve from that branch in repository settings.
